## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
I am generally left a bit confused from the JSisSexy article about callback functions.  Mostly because some of the
terminology is unfamiliar, but I would be if I reread the article next week, it will make perfect sense.


** after morning's lesson, I am feeling much better about callbacks.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
At what point do students in WDI generally start to be able to write functions like the ones we are working on this week
as second nature.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I think I have made significant progress, but I definitely feel like I should be making more.  I will be able to evaluate
better on Monday after having the weekend to really sit down and review this week's material and play around with it.
I want to push myself to the point where I am consistantly all fives during the week for comfort and clarity.  While I
don't mind relying on my peers for help, I would rather spend my energy helping others understand the material.  I am
the type of person who needs to procees things somewhat slowly until I hit my 'ah-ha' moment, then I can ramp up and
absorb more information rapidly.  It hasn't happened yet, but I am confident that point is not too distant.
