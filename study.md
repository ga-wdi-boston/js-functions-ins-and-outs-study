## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything
you were confused about.

```md
I think I get callbacks but I do feel a little fuzzy so I think I need to do
some exercises to get really comfortable with them.

```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
Should I tend to use function declarion only when I am defining a callback
within the argument list of a function (like forEach), but otherwise stick to
function expressions and/or named function expressions?

When should I use an FE vs NFE? I have been using NFEs but I don't know if
it really matters (I hadn't really thought about it before). 
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I am really very confident with the material so far, but I also know how little
we actually have covered, so I know I am just a n00b.

(myObjective is: `this instanceof l33t h4x0r === true`)
```
