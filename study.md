## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
I am confused about the situations in which you would want to use function declarations vs. function expressions. It seems like the hoisting of declarations is more of a pain than simply invoking a function expression.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
I just need a little practice with hoisting and scope issues.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
As I've mentioned to my squad (on many occassions), I oscillate between confidence and despair.
This is par for the course though. One of my biggest issues is describing why something does, or does not, work. I feel as though I am getting a strong grasp on the JS we have covered so far, but I struggle with articulating concepts such as scope, hoisting, and knowing the correct name for things.

Overall though, I think I am doing really well and already feel myself thinking about problems differently.
