```md
I don't think that have a full grasp of hoisting yet, and I would like to see some additional examples of it in class.
```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
No specific nagging questions.  As I mentioned above, I'd like to see some additional examples of hoisting, and I think that some discussion around function statements vs function declarations would be helpful.
```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md

Between the pre-work and the first week of WDI, I certainly have much more development knowledge than I did when I entered the program.  As someone with no prior development experience, I find that I need to spend an extensive amount of time reviewing the materials outside of class in order to feel comfortable with them.  That being said, I entered WDI expecting the demands to be high, and I am prepared to continue applying myself 100% to learning as much as possible.  There are still some concepts that we have convered that I have not yet fully grasped, and I will continue to work on those concepts until I feel proficient in them.  The next eleven weeks will be a journey - I'm excited to have gotten started, and I am looking forward to immersing myself in this experience and emerging as a capable developer.
