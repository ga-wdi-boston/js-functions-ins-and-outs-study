## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused
about.

```md
I am still a little confused on declarations v. expresssions. I understand
them in concept, but when I look at a function I haven't been getting the
correct answer. Also the boolean concepts of truthy / falsey are still a little
fuzzy especially when they relate to functions.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
I think the most recent lessons about "this" and properties actually made
functions more clear for me now that we know more about how it all comes
together and see how they would be used in the real world.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I feel really good about the first week. I cant believe how much we have
already learned in such a short amount of time. I am really, really enjoying
the class. There are definintely some things I need to review again. I
understand them when we go through them step by step in class, but when it
comes to solving a problem I have had a hard time figuring out how to apply
the tools that we have learned. I need to go look at the MBTA exercise again.
When I initially worked on it I spent a lot of time thinking about it, but
didnt get very far with the code.
