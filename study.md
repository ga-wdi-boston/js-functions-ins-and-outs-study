I'm still trying to find out the answer. I think I already learned a lot, but it can always be better. Some concepts are still new and confusing, but examples are useful.

 I'm ready to devote my time, and to learn as much as I can. Learning new language is hard, and learning programming language in few weeks is challenging. Pracice makes it permanent, but I don't think that the length of this program will allow me to make it permanent. Or at least not yet.

 I think that in a week or two I might have better picture.
