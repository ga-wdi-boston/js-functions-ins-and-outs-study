## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.


For the most part understanding how functions work and writing for myself is the hardest, but I am getting better as understanding the logic the more I work on them and see them being writing. Ara was a big help in breaking it down for me. Understanding that the variable is the thing that never changes helps and the function is the change we want to make. 


Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?
Not yet...

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

I feel like my progress as a developer is pretty novice of course. I am pushing myself to learn quickly, and manage my time. I think the progess I am making is expected because the course is tough but I know I can do it. I'm building upon what I know, and what I've learned each day.
