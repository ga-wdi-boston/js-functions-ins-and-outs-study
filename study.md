## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

```md
I understan the definition of a callback function, but it confusing to understand why they
are important without any context around the examples.


```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
I'm having a hard time deteriming what new variables I need to create in order to use in
the function itself to get my end result. For example, I'm still unclear on how to retrieve the
unique values from an array. I plan to ask someone for help in the next work shop session
we have.
```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md
I can feel myself learning but I feel like it as a much slower rate than the pace of the class.
The dianogstic that require coding take me longer than the alotted 30 mins because I
still need a lot of time to think through the problem an design my answer.

Luckily, I've worked with developers in the past so I know that it is normal for the design
process to be very collaborative. I know I will get there, it just may take me longer than others.
```
