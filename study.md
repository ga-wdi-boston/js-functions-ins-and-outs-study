## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
The hoisting and returns was a bit confusing.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
If a function doesn't have a name, what is its purpose?
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I'm feeling alright about it. Certain things have clicked while others havent quite yet.
I'm still getting used to some of the jargon which at times throws me off because I
forget what some words mean. The most confusing thing at this moment is
the prototypes. Im somewhat comfortable with 'this' but in certain situations im not
100% sure what 'this' will refer to. 
```
