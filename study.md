## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

```md
Regarding callback functions, I understand the concept behind the need for using
call and apply functions in the case of using "this" in order to retain the
context. However, the example provided in javascriptissexy.com was not clear
enough on how to create call and apply functions, as well as the difference
of usage between the two types of functions.
```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
No, not at the moment, other than call/apply functions.
```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md
I do feel that I'm at the "informed pessimism" stage (as described by one of our
consultants, Mike Finneran) as the learning topics becomes more and more difficult,
particularly regarding Javascript. It was discouraging at first to not be able to
understand some coding problems even after our consultants go over the solution.
However, since I am the type of person who needs to take time alone to think
thoroughly through a problem in order to solve coding challenges, I've
realized that I shouldn't feel bad for not understanding it in class because
everyone has his or her own ways of learning. For me, I have difficulty making
sense of all the material in a classroom setting (especially with a limited
amount of time) so it's really important for me to review the lecture notes and
redo the coding practices at home. All in all, I believe that I am making good
progress as a developer, at least in my own way.
