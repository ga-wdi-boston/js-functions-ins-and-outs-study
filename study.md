## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
I understand Arrays, Functions and Objects. However, I am a liitle bit confused on callback functions
on how they can be used effectively.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
How many ways can you use a function? There are callback functions, functional expressions, function declarations, etc. It would be nice, to see a table of all of the different styles a developer can use a function and a column with a pros/cons to that style.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
Unsure at the moment. I'm understanding more about Javascript each day and practicing on CodeWars,
but I run into a wall when I'm presented with a challenge and figuring out how to start. Whiteboarding is great
to figure out what you need to do, but the application of how to attack it -- is where lies my issue.
