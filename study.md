```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I have learned and advanced quite a bit this week and I'm very excited for the
future.  I am better able to effectivly break down a problem into smaller parts
and I believe will be the key to my progress as a developer.
I like the course style of pushing us beyond our knowledge and then discussing
concepts at a slightly lower level, as I feel that a person develops a skill
most effectively when repeatedly forced to lean on their intuitions.  That
process has allowed me to see my strengths and faults more clearly so that I can
better conceptualize and break down what I need to achieve in any given
programming problem.
