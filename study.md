## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
Arrays were by far the foggiest for me, how to use empty arrays specifically.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
No questions, would like how and where should a function be passed as an argument.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
As was described to me on the first day of orientation, I find myself deep in the valley of developer dispair, feeling overwhelmed and behind. However I do see huge improvements to my knowledge and skill in coding and problem solving almost daily, which is extremely encouraging. I find myself struggling to make the adjustment to thinking and operating "like a developer" but I dont feel like it's something I can't do, in fact I beleive it's more enivitable provided I can continue. It would be nice to be caught up.
```
