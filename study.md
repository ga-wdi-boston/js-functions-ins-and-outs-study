## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md

var x = calculate(4,5,9);
var y = calculate((x/3),3,5);

I don't understand this. ^

I'm also not very clear on function declarations the way it was presented in
the article.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
I'm having issues visualizing a place I would use an unnamed function.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I want to start out by saying that this is the best class I have ever taken.
And in additon the most serious I have taken a course since drivers ed. With
that said, there are certainly things I feel that I am grasping but others that
seem to be a little over my head/ not clicking yet. I'm being as
dilligent as possible with going back over things I don't understand, and
will continue to give you 100%.

Thank you,

I'm truly enjoying the course and look forward to grasping more as time goes on.

ps. I do feel like I have an issue when it comes to problem solving. I know
pt. Jeff mentioned writing out the code beforehand... I just freeze up
pu. when I am faced with a question to solve. (better yet I just feel like
sometimes I don't know where to start at all.. but I know its still very early)
