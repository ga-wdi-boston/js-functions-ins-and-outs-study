## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
Everything was pretty straight forward and I had a fundamental understanding
of everything that was talked about in the links.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
I was confused about Function Declarations vs. Function. It wasn't very
clear for me.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I feel that I'm progressing more and more each day, a big problem that
I am having though is that when we are given a problem like the subway homework
or boggle I have a hard time translating the problem into code. For
the most part I'm comfortable with the pace we are going at and able to process
more as we go on.
```
