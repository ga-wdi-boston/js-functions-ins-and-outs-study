Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I have beeb going from feeling totally lost to to feeling like things are starting to make sense. Today was a good day except for the challenge in the morning. Overall I don't feel like I am where I should be with JS, but I am making progress. If there is anything additional I can do that will help I am willing to put the work in. This weekend I will go through some online JS tutorials.
