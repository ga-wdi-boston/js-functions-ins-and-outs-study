## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
I'm mostly confused about the callbacks reading, particularly on setting up a
working callback function. Additionally, I'm unclear on the issues surrounding
the context of the object and how to correct this by using other methods,
like call and apply.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
Which function do you know is the appropriate tool for problem solving? The end
of the reading about callback functions mentions when such a function is
frequently used, but I still don't understand those instances or instances when
constructor functions are worth using. 
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
At this point I would be hard pressed to say that I was not feeling overwhelmed,
but I completely understand that it is part of the process. Thus far I would
say that I have a fair understanding of the concepts, some more than others.
```
