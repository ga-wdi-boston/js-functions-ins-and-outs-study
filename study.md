## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
Functions definitely confuse me, not what they are, just the execution of them.
I think it's just because I need to do them more.  I understand that they are actions, that you have to name them, that you need to refer back to whatever you're using that function for, you have to give it a place to start and end, and you have to tell it what you want it to return.  It's an equation and you have to have all the elements of
an equation for it to work.  It's going from understanding the definitions to putting
it down in code (lol) that is the problem for me. I have trouble writing it.

All of the terms are confusing me too.  Very generic, dry wording.  attributes, properties, arguments, etc.  It'll just take a little time to be able to recall them, but I will.  Unless you guys want to rewrite javascript definitions for me.  

Callback functions are confusing, or at least the way that the explanation was written is confusing.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
I just need more practice implementing them, seeing how they translate from english
to a webpage.  Everything seems so complicated when I look at a blank screen but I think I'm making it that way.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
Whew.  I am slowly understanding the concepts.  Again, as far as writing code, kind of a big part of being a developer, I'm feeling a little lost.  It DOES feel like I've been here for a month.  When I sit back and tell myself it's only been 4 days and I'm not supposed to be a pro at it yet, I feel a little better.  I wish I had gone a little deeper in the months before class, but honestly, it's hard to know just what you're
getting into.  A lot is piled on in this first week.  I might suggest that GA really press that issue to people, to CODE! CODE! CODE! before thay get here.  I think it would have helped a lot.  So, I'm feeling.....ok.  I guess.  My team members are helping a lot (they are very good at this, which is pretty annoying).  I'll get there!
