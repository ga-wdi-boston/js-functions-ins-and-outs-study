## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything
you were confused about.

```md
Nothing so far
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
Not that I can think of right now.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I am really very confident with the material so far, but I also know how little
we actually have covered, so I know I am just a n00b.

I want to be a l33t h4x0r.
```
