## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
Still confused why some of the examples have "var" in them. And also I think i need a refresher on what forEach does again.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
I havent run into an issue yet with it but why do we have to put a word in parenthesis after function sometimes like function (word) and other times we dont?
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
It seems to go on a day by day basis. Somedays are good and somedays are bad. Reading code has gotten a lot better for me so I can understand what the written code is trying to do and the concept. However, I'm still getting stuck a lot starting problems. That is why I love the trainings or studies where we have example code I can look at. Not to just copy of course but to refer to when I get stuck. It helps me visualize how to go about structuring the code and then I can do it on my own. Still a little in the woods on what all of the new coding "vocab" words can do but I'm hoping that comes along with time.
