## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

```md
1. i dont't understand how callback functions are called back at a later time.
2.  I don't understand an exampe of a function in an article:
function example(a,b) {
	number += a;
	alert('You have chosen: ' + b);
};
what is the point of line 28 since the function just gives back an alert?

3. I am confused about function declaration and expression
is this a function decleration?:
function foo() {
 console.log('hello');
}; and can be called above where it's defined because it's hoisted?

and is this a function expression?:
const x = function foo() {
 console.log('hello');
}; and it can only be called below it is defined? ```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
See the 1st question.```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md
I have mixed feelings.
I completly understand GitHub (for now, I'm sure there is more to it than we've been taught)
I also feel super about the basic of Java that we covered during the 2nd day.
However, the 3rd day (wed) and the 4th (thu) were on a whole other level! This is good, but it does create problems as there are tougher concept to understand. I am finding it tough to wrap my head around class topics. Topics from the homework are easier in a sense as I can pull up a video that explains something, pause it, understand what is going on and etc.. and keep playing it. In the class an error may occur which takes me a minute or two to resolve (check all syntax, run grunt nagg, etc..) but by then the class may have started a new topic/concept and I'm now playing catch up for who knows how long. This makes it tough to stay positive but if other have done it, than I should be able to too.
Furthermore, a blank black screen doesn't feel like a painting canvas yet but I feel much more confident in my use of the terminal than 4 days ago!```
