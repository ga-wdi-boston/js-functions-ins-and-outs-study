## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

```md
I'm still trying to learn more about callback functions and when to use them
vs a function declartion. Also, I am still confused about the this keyword
and when to use it in a function.
```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
Aside from above, I struggle when it comes to more complex functions. I now
understand simple functions and the concepts, but as we get into functions that
require complex calculations (ex. the run tracker functions), it becomes
more difficult to grasp where all the information we're using is coming from/stored.
```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md
Honestly, I felt overwhelmed after the first week. With differing backgrounds
and skill levels in the class, I felt like I was behind the curve. I put in
a lot of work over the weekend, rereading trainings, completing javascript
code school, and watching funfunfunctions YouTube tutorials. I feel better after
doing those and am in a better spot. It will take some time but I think I've
made a lot of progress through one week. I still have trouble iterating through
arrays and sub arrays and have made that a focus point. ```
