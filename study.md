## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

```md
The readings were 'digestable'... till the last one on Function Declarations vs
Function.  The reading gave some examples of code and how would it be executed.
It was confusing and I don't think I understand how I would use these concepts
in my code.
```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
No questions...reading and apply the concepts are two different things. Especially
after the reading on Declarations vs Expressions.  I feel that all
the areas related to functions I can work with in my code, except for the
above mentioned.
```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md
I struggled with git and the process flow the first few days.  I it get now, yeah!

I also had a hard time trying to execute my code when working on assignments.  I
Was cutting and pasting into the browser console to run it.  I finally figured
out how to use node and loading the js file.  I can also use node to look at
the function and see the key value pairs. Executing the various methods to
run code is now possible, making the assignments much easier(working on
code and not struggling with execution), yeah!

I do struggle with time constraints when doing the diagnostics. At times its
 like a panic attack and I can't do simple things.  Chris slacked out the link
 for typing practice for programmers.  I'm hoping this will help.  Any other
 suggestions for working in these conditions will be helpful.

I also need to become more proficient with grunt and the various commands.
I plan on reviewing some the the trainings to see what I can gather on usage.
I starting using nag and test...are there any others that can help in getting
code executing properly?

Currently I'm debugging code using the console log. Are there other ways to
figure out why something is not working, like logic errors?c

We covered a ton of material in a few days. I found that reviewing the material
after class, it becomes clearer, especially working on the code
that is unfinished.

Personally I prefer to listen then to code along.  If I'm typing and coding
along I lose some of what is being said or talked about. Should I code along
or just stop and listen?

How does one define a developer? My knowledge in this space has grown
tremendously in a few days. If one defines a develoer as gaining skills, yes
I would say I'm on my way!
