## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
```
When a nameless function is passed in a function does that callback already have
to be defined or can it be defined in the body of the root/object function?

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
```
I'm a little unclear about how functions are passed in as arguments so the
whole code is executed, i.e. rockpaper scissors playToFive had functions as
arguments.

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
<!-- your answer here -->

I feel as though I am making progress everyday. I am putting in consistant
effort and that makes a big effect. I give myself credit for this. I feel
anxious to ask questions about topics already covered and this effects my
progress in that I later have to research and understand it. I realize this "
understand later" process is what the class is doing and that retroactive
comprehension is part of the process/progress.
