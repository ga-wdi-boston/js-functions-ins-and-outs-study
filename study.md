## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
<!-- I understand what callback is, but I'm having trouble figuring out some of the examples covered in the the Quirksmode reading:
(http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-callback-functions-and-use-them/). Specifically, the 'callback (firstName, lastName);' portion of the 'Problem When Using Methods With The this Object as Callbacks' section and the following portion of the code:
   function getInput (options, callback) {
      allUserData.push (options);
      callback (options);
  }'

I'm having a hard time following what 'options' is indicating and how callback is being used. I understand that 'callback' is a parameter, but I dont understand whats happening in the 'callback(options);' row.

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
<!-- There is nothing that is dramatically outstanding as of right now. As I mention it my response below, I know
that I need to solidify my understanding of JavaScript basics before I can accuratley articluate what about these more complex JavaScript topics is confusing me.   -->
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md

<!-- JavaScript has me a bit confused still. I've understood the lessons on 10/19 and
10/20, but when I'm having trouble applying them to topics we've covered earlier
in the week. I'm going to review the fundamenals course work and the topics
that we've reviewed in class over the weekend to clear up this confusion before
next week. I essentially plan on starting from the ground up again but with a
more effective methodology. I'm confident in my understanding of the logic, but
I'm having trouble with the proper notation. -->
