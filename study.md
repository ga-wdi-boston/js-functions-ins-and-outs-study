## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

```md

Not so much confused, but I'd like to wrap my head around the difference between console.log() and return.
I did some prelim research and multiple websites insisted that although similar, they do very different things.
I guess 'return' does a calc and console.log() just regurgitates info?
It's still not very clear to me...

```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md

I'm stuck around the idea of hoisting. I think I'll just need to do more reading into it.
The web blog article on function declarations vs. function expressions had the 4 quiz examples, which I wasn't able to get.
I'll see if I still have any questions on it after class on Monday.


```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md

Overall I feel like my progress as a programmer is coming along well. It's tough to remember that I've really only got about a weeks worth of programming knowledge and that I can't learn it all in one sitting. I'm still very optimistic and excited to learn as much as I can. Even though there are definitely times where I feel lost and not sure where to start, there are plenty of resources to help and I'm able to feel comfortable placing a bookmark on a topic for reviewing later.

Googling answers to questions on my own is very helpful, but it can be little bit daunting at the same time since the more I know, the more doors it opens for even more questions to be asked. But there is just not enough time to know it all! That's a frame of mind that I still have trouble adopting -- I know I'll need to come to terms that I'll never be able to know all there is about JS. And that's OK.

There were a number of topics I wanted to spend time reviewing this weekend and I'm very happy with the progress I've made. I was able to complete some of the labs and practices which I wasn't able to complete in class. I feel good about making objects and functions and feel like I understand constructors and prototypes pretty well. I could still use some extra practice on building some of the more mathematical functions (ifs, word counting, etc. )but otherwise I feel like I have a good grasp on the basics.

Looking forward to continuing the program!
