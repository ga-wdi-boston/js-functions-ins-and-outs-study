## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
All the articles are pretty clear on the subject, but I do need to do more practices with Javascript to see if I indeed understand the subject or not.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
No, but I will ask when the time comes.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I wouldn't say I have progressed alot, but I'm making improvements. I am still trying to get ahold of the basics/fundamentals of Javascript and it is still very difficult for me to comprehend and breaking the problem down into pieces.  
```
