## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.


I am confused about “hoisting” and what is getting hoisted? that went over my head, I read it a few times and couldn’t figure it out.
As far as some of the readings I am confused when new “terms” seem to be included in functions without them being declared: as an example :

var friends = ["Mike", "Stacy", "Andy", "Rick”];
 friends.forEach(function(eachName, index){
console.log(index+1+". "+eachName);
});
How did the eachName and index get defined?
​

```md

```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
My biggest point of confusion and maybe it will come with seeing functions over and over is when and how to construct loops.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
The big question…
I “feel” like I have stepped in a minefield, and there are bullets flying around me; I don’t know where my gun is and my head is ringing.
 There is sooo much information being presented that while my mind is “baking the delicate soufflé" of the concept just discussed the door to the oven is ripped open and a loaf of Pumpernickel is jammed in deflating the soufflé.  While that’s cooking… holy shit here come a rump roast!
Creating something out of nothing is hard enough, but when you now have 30 minutes to do it minus the time it takes my dumbass to read the directions, fork, clone, branch…red wire, blue wire; which one do I cut??? and seriously who the fuck is throwing a yellow and green wires in there too?
I am being exposed to code for the first time and like learning a foreign language I can’t read it, or write it but I am recognizing words and phrases.
I don’t know if I am progressing along at the proper pace, but I am going to do the work and put the time in because… fuck it! I paid for the class, and by my count that’s 13,500 questions I get to ask!
