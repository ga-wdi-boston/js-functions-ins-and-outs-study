## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
callbacks, I see how they are called, but I am fuzzy how arguments get passed to them.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
how do I a value outside of a function to change. for example
x = 23
changeX(){
x = 12;
}
changeX();

when I run this x is affect inside the scope of the function and will temporarily by 12 until
the function ends. How do I get a function to affect things outside of it scope?
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I feeling really strong, I feel like I have all the tools neccessary to solve alot of problems
i would run into. Now I need practice solving real world issues with code. It cool to return values and such and in a sense we are solving problems, but I would like do more problems where the issue is describe and I am asking to break it down into code.
```
