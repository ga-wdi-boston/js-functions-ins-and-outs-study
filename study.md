## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
I feel good about the concepts in the readings, just need more pracitce coding with them
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
No, just more practice
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I need more hands on practice using the material we've gone over.  The exercises are great,
just need more time to work on them.  In a previous life, I was much better at recongizing
the coding solution, I'm hoping to get back to that with additional practice.
