## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

```md
They were all pretty straightforward and clear, though I will need more practice
with this keyword.
```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
Not really, just need to practice more to make it second-nature.
```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md
So far I'm feeling ok, not great, not bad. It's been a long first week and I
needed a break to recharge by the end. The concept of scope along with this is
still a bit confusing to me, and more practice will hopefully help make what
I've learned sink in better. I definitely feel like I'm learning a lot and am
confident I can solve basic problems given enough time, but it requires a lot of
forethought, research, and trial-and-error. So far I've enjoyed my time at GA,
you all rock!
