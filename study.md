## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

Function delcarataions vs function expressions... I thought I understood it when I started reading the jsweblog article, but then I got more and more confused as I read. Looking forward to seeing some examples in class.

In general, I find it difficult and confusing to read about code. I definitely learn this stuff best by seeing it demonstrated in class, then being able to practice it right away. 
```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
In the solution branch for the MBTA assignment, I noticed some crazy syntax for creating a new function.
  const functionName = () =>
    function logic

Is this something we should be doing? are there advantages/disadvantages to this over the way we've been doing it using:
  const functionName = function() {}
```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md
I am feeling pretty good. There was a moment last week, while working on the MBTA assignment, that I felt a little panicked. I understood what was being asked, and I understood the code I needed to use to make it work - but for some reason I stared at the blank .js file and didn't even know where to begin.

Since then, I've focused on breaking things down into smaller, easier to solve pieces. Life has been much better.

Also, towards the end of last week, I realized that I LOVE coding. I find myself opening a console while watching TV just to write some random loops. Definitely eager to learn more.
