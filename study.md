## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

```md
so personally for my self its much easier to see (either in video or in calss)
when we are talking about new stuff.
i got confuse with the function callback mostly after reading the article.
i feel like i know whats the meaning of comeback but i dont understand how it works.


```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
mostly about function declarations and function expressions. i dont really understand when to use what.
```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md
by far i feel much better at understanding a lot of stuff that i didnt think that i will understand so fast.
the thing is that i need to see couple of examples writting in front of me or with me to get it memorized. for example on today's challange i didnt write any code and it took me long time to understand the instructions but once we had time in workshop, Wei tried to explain me stuff that i didnt understand and helped me to understand it just by making me do it in a different ways.
so in general im prerry setisfide with my progress but i just wish that when i see a blak page in diagnostics i wouldnt freez and actually submit somthing next time.

```
