## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
* IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)? from the MDN function expression
readying. Also a bit confused why you would need to refer to the current function
within the function body. Wouldn't that create an endless loop?
* I'm not sure callback functions are really clicking. Will help to have someone
explain them in class tomorrow.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
What are first-class objects exactly? Are there other types of classes?
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
Morale is high! That being said, JavaScript is what I was most familiar with
coming into this--so I certainly expect to face some roadblocks in the weeks ahead
with languages I have no experience with. Also feel like I'm getting a handle on Git
this week (at least with the WDI workflow), so that's nice.
```
