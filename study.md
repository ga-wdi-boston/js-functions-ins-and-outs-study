## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
I am slightly confused about the concept of function declarations versus
function expressions assigned to variables.
I understand that hoisting is a part of the issue but not sure why
declarations tend to cause problems.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
I am having a little trouble understanding the concept of scope with functions,
and identifying what is reachable and what is not within different functions.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I am feeling very excited! I know we are just beginning to scratch the
surface of the material that we will need to master, but I am really
enjoying the process and trying not to stress when there are things that I
cannot fully comprehend right away.

I love the structure of the lessons and also the general thought process that
we have been introduced to by our instructional team (growth mindset,
breaking things down into simple problems, giving it a try without fear of
failure.)
```
