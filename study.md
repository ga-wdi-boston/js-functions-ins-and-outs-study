## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

```md
I think the rules of return statements are something I still struggle with. My understanding was that as soon as you see a return statement in any context, the function essentially stops running and returns whatever it is told to return at that moment, but clearly that is not the case everytime. I will read this article over a few more times.

```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
  I've been reading about callback functions for over a year and I would be lying to say that they always make complete sense to me even though I feel pretty good about them conceptually. I guess my question is more along the lines of whether or not there is any advice of dealing with seemingly complex callback functions and how they can be broken down in a more simple way.
```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md
I have lots of up and downs on a daily basis.

First, the bad:
 Today's diagnostic and challenge were the lowest I've felt and I was confused about how much I was really supposed to understand. My understanding of grunt is not where it should be and I had trouble understanding what the challenge today was even asking me to do. I get overwhelmed in my head and have trouble articulating my train of thought sometimes to myself and others in my group.

I am worried I am not understanding some things quickly enough. The git visuals from the homework on git were only supposed to take an hour according to the readme, but I spent over two hours on it and still could not finish about a quarter of it. I understand that a lot of the material builds on itself, so I get anxious when I think about the fact that I have trouble understanding some concepts this early on.

The good:
I've made more progress with git and the command line in the past few days then over a year of trying to learn some of this stuff on my own. Even understanding what node is  and navigating through it has just happened this week for me after hearing about it forever. I feel like I have helped some people in my group and contributed to their understanding of some concepts. Even when I didn't articulate myself particularly well, I had the right understanding of what I was trying to explain in my head, even if though did not come out as eloquently as I hoped. I think I understand what we are at least trying to do most of the time.

If I were to encapsulate how I feel in one word, it would be humbled. I have been trying to learn this stuff on my own for quite awhile and am seeing how little I know about some of the topics I thought I knew quite a bit about. Sitting in the discomfort is hard, but I will keep working on coping better with it. I am definitely making progress but I am also definitely uncomfortable a lot of the time. I am getting used to it more and more.
