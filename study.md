## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
I wouldn't say I am confused about anything, its just a lot to take in. I learn
things at a slower pace so when we get new things to learn, I need time to
fully grasp what I am doing. As of right now, I'm pretty good with Git and GitHub.
I know how to navigate and work in the terminal. With JavaScript, I just need
more practice to remember how to do certain things.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
No nagging questions
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
Its tough but I think with the right amount of time and practice, I can succeed.
I still feel like I've only scratched the surface but I feel confident to say I'm
well on my way to being a good developer. I know things will get harder but my
problem solving skills are increasing. I'll have the right means to answer or
do a problem but will forget functions or make stupid spelling mistakes to hinder
my code. So all in all, I just need to make sure I practice a lot.
```
