## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
I am confused about the object as a key. Still fuzzy about dic. I thought I had the 'this'
part understood but got confused about the constructor. ```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
I still get a bit hung up on functions when it comes to passing on the data. I frankly
a bit terrifed by the actual word 'function' at this point.```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I'm actually shocked by how clueless I am on some of these topics. I feel like
everyday I have an issue with something. It would appear that I get most of it when it's
being explained, but when it comes time to do it, I freeze up a bit. I freeze on the
word 'function' and maybe, perhaps 'arrays' and the connection of the two. Feels like I have
to do a lot of my searching, not for the answer but the understanding. If I don't see the
why, it's hard for me to even come close to the writing the code. And then there are many
times I can see the why, but can't correlate that into the code. But I desperately want to
understand every part of this. It's very important to me that I get this. It's been a very
tiring two weeks. I will say that I underestimated the pre-work and that threw me off. I was
actually working on another manual that I thought would give me more clarity. As a result, I
rushed into doing the pre-work and didn't give it the respect it deserved. So that's a black
mark on me. With all that said. I feel very, very behind when I thought I'd be ahead in my
understanding up to this point.```
