## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
I am still confused about callback functions. is the callback function just a parameter of the function that it is in; or is it a separate entity - applicalbe tho other objects?

```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
Are there any 'golden rules' for writing functions-conventions that are applicable to all functions and function types?
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I am making progress as a developer. The amount of progress is varied depending on the subject.
I feel like I have a  better time grasping the 'why' of how things work rather than the 'how' things work. It is easier for me to listen to a lecture or look at code and understand how everything is supposed to fit together.
The difficulty for me is in taking the concepts and applying them myself. I believe this is something that will improve with more time/practice.
