## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
I feel like I am going to get tripped up on how to apply callback functions properly. I get the idea, I just know that it will take me a bit to grasp properly. Same thing with the finer points of function definitions vs expressions.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
Nothing in particular.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I feel like I an making headway and I am still very excited about learning more. I just want to make sure I stay up with everything.
```
