# Functions Study

## Required Readings

-   JSIS [Callbacks](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-callback-functions-and-use-them/)
-   Quirksmode [Functions Basics](http://www.quirksmode.org/js/function.html)

There is no requirement to follow any links from these pages.

## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

  I'm still a little confused about the difference between function declarations and expressions. I thought I understood the difference from reading the MDN reference pages, but after reading the JS Webblog article, I'm second guessing myself. I'm not sure when a function declaration is a declaration, and when it's just an expression assigned to a variable (and if that's even the right line of thinking!)

  I'm also curious about the call / apply functions. They came up in last night's reading as well on `this`, and the JSIS link here did a good job giving me an introduction, but I'm still not entirely sure how I would use one in practice.


  I feel okay about my understanding of how callbacks work at present. At least I don't have any persisting questions.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
See above! Mostly the difference between function expressions and function declarations, as well as when/how to use the call()/apply() functions.

```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I am feeling pretty good about my progress thus far! I'm fortunate enough to be coming to this somewhat familiar with some core concepts like for loops, if statements, and functions, but I really feel like my understanding of those things has solidified over the past few days. I also feel like a lot of the vocabulary is starting to click with concepts I've encountered before on my own but didn't understand, and that vocabulary is helping me to understand the structure and principles of how programming works (sort of). I'm mostly thinking of Object Oriented programming here, as that's a concept that I have struggled with for a _very_ long time on my own and was never able to grasp. While I definitely don't fully get it yet, I already feel like things are beginning to fall into place and I'm seeing patterns. I'm really enjoying everything so far, and can't wait to keep learning! Thank you!
