## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
I still find the concept of hoisting to be confusing.  Specifically, I do not understand how return does not break the function in situations involving hoisting.  The article mentions that exceptions are made due to "context", but I do not understand what this means.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
A workaround for dealing with anonymous function expressions was to name the function the same as the variable in the expression - e.g. var today = function today() {return new Date()}

However, the end of the article says that this is incompatible with explorer < 9.  Therefore, should this method be practice to help prevent bugs or is there another recommended solution.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

So far, I am confident that I am keeping pace with the class.  My biggest problem involves terminology.  I often forget what certain terms mean and struggle to keep up with the class when this happens.  In terms of strenghts, I believe that I understand the fundamentals related to git and JavaScript (arrays, functions, and objects).  In terms of weaknesses, I have difficulty with the concept of modeling and struggle to determine whether to treat a key as a attribute or method.  Finally, I think I need a great deal of practice writing functions.  It is something I know with come with the progression of the class.
