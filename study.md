## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
I confused about attached code listed in JSIS[callback] reference. Attached forEach function works for each every element of the array, but in that anonymous function, how it seperate 'eachName'(each element) and 'index'(each element's index) and then passing those for arguments?
    var friends = ["Mike", "Stacy", "Andy", "Rick"];
​
        friends.forEach(function (eachName, index){
        console.log(index + 1 + ". " + eachName); // 1. Mike, 2. Stacy, 3. Andy, 4. Rick​
      });
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
Not right now except the above one.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I am getting some confident about this new area. I am really happy that I start to think like a developer and use tools (gitHub and command lines) like a true developer in just four days. But I know that I only know tip of the iceberg, and I still need to learn a lot and practice a lot to truly get into this field.
