## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
Function expressions are still a little confusing and I'm still a little unclear on and how they relate to callback functions. Also how to implement all of these things properly but I think a lot of that will come with practice.

```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
I think the one thing I'm still trying to wrap my head around is how you know whether or not to use a callback function and when it's ok to leave it anonymous or when it's ideal to name them.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
It's kind of early to make any definitive assertions, especially when my level of grasping the material fluctuates wildly from hour to hour. However, I'm ending the day in a pretty secure place. I feel like I understand pretty much everything we've covered so far and that, like with any language, the more I use it, the more innate it'll become. Eventually I'll get to the point where I'm less dependent on examples and notes but I think a lot of that will come with implementing these concepts more and more. I don't feel totally lost at all, am pretty optimistic, and perhaps most importantly, if I feel a little lost, I'm not going to despair. Yesterday I felt slightly behind but today I feel like I'm doing pretty well. So. Fluctuations expected, struggling is okay, and I feel comfortable asking for help. My mind is working and engaged and I'm interested in the content and motivated to understand for my own gratification, not because it's expected of me alone.
