## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
I was more confused about the Function declarations vs expressions.  The Callback functions made sense and I tested them to see how they worked but I did find them confusing as well.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
I do have a few questions, specifically around breaking a problem down into its pieces to tackle the code.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
It's up and down to be honest.  Monday was a good day, Tuesday I began to feel a little lost (when we hit functions).  Things began to click somewhat on Wednesday but by Thursday mid-morning I was feeling that perhaps my optimism on Wednesday was misplaced.  As I was reading the materials for study this evening (Thursday) I received feedback that the JS-Basics diagnostic responses that I provided were incorrect.    I have purchased a book on JS basics this afternoon that I am reading to see if it will help me.
