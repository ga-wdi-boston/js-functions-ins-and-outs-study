## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

```md
<!-- I'm still unclear as to the Immediately Invoked Function Expression fixing the closure bug which causes every position in the array to come back with 103 as their ID in the http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-closures-with-ease/ reading. -->
```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
<!-- not that I can think of.  I feel like we're just at the tip of the iceberg, so I don't really know what questions to ask unless I run into an issue.  One thing I want to be clear on: a <return> will end a function, except for that one situation in the https://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/07/06/function-declarations-vs-function-expressions/ and in an if loop.  Correct? or am I way off? -->
```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md
<!-- I think I still know too little to give a great answer.  That being said, and since I have to give an answer :) I feel like I'm grasping the concepts well, but struggling a bit to execute some of the more complicated code when we're asked to put it into practice before seeing an example.  I'm still training my brain to think like a developer, and any additional guidance on training my brain - any extra exercises, readings, anything - would be awesome.  I was very lost in the middle of last week, but as we inched towards Friday, things started to click a little bit better.  I need to spend more time writing pseudocode and then code, but I do feel like I've made progress, but I'm not sure if I'm on track or behind.  Regardless, I think it's fascinating and love reading and learning about everything we've learned so far.  It's difficult, but I like that. -->
