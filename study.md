## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
I'm not completely sure that I understand the idea of hoisting, and especially of variable hoisting vs function hoisting.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
Is there any reason to allow hoisting to occur? Wouldn't it be better to almost always declare functions and variables at the beginning of scope?
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I feel pretty strong so far, but I think it's mostly based on the knowledge I had coming in. I think that tonights study is the first set of things that I hadn't REALLY studied in depth before, and I'm not completely sure that I have it.
```
