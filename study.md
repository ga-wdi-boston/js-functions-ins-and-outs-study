<!-- So far this week has been a good refresher to some of the things I've learned
when I was in college. I studied CompSci, so I am familiar with many of the concepts such as
objects, variables, functions, loops, arrays, version control. I did a lot of OOP coding in Java and C++ in the past
but I haven't really touched it in a few years after college. Since I haven't been in academia in so long, it has been
a bit of a struggle to retain the volume of information, and to keep up with the pace at which the information is given thus far.
Although I am a bit burnt out at this point, I believe it will get better after this transition week, and once I review/digest the material over the weekend.
I am definitely having a lot of fun and enjoying class.   -->
