```md
Call back function i understand but a little fizzy.
```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
I'm reviewing loops, it seems that i have a problem using it in most of our application
in class.  Even if i know what it does and what uses it can do.  I blank out when
writing the actually function to pull the right loop to get the data i need.
```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md
Its rough for me.  I feel like i'm always behind and unable to write out the concepts
in my head to code.  Things that should be easy turn out to be hard.  For myself
that has no coding exp, I have to review everyday after class to get the content
that we discess a few days ago then after getting it, we already 2 more days head
with more content for me to review.

Though i'm not stress about it, the feeling of being behind and not able to proform
the way i use to my other roll is a little depressing.  But i'm sure i'll get it in gear
just need to push through and work harder in applying myself into writing code.
I dont have to much of an issue learning the content but knowing and applying seems world
apart for me.

Otherwise feeling like i need to step up my game, its good given that I just realize
its only our 5 day.  Feel like weeks to be honest lol.
