## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
I understand how callback functions work but it would be nice to see some
actual 'real-life' examples of use.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
Not particularly, but I am sure I will encounter some as I go along!
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I am feeling confident in my progress as a developer thus far. Having some
development experience before hand it is quite fulfilling to apply it in
concrete ways and also help others to further their programming skills. There
are some things that trip me up but after I use them sufficiently (the node/js
interpreter is really great for this practice) I usually am quite competent in
how they are used and applied. I am certainly looking forward to the projects
where I can put everything I know and have learned to use!
