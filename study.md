## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
Nothing really--I was glad to see the reading on function declarations vs. expressions because that was something I had been wondering about. Many of the online tutorials I had done primarily favored function declarations, and I had wondered why we'd avoided them in class so far.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
Not at the moment.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I am feeling okay, but it's only been four days since class began. So far, most of what's been covered has been review for me, from either the fundamentals for this class or other tutorials I completed online. These days have been helpful in solidifying and clarifying a lot of concepts I have seen before, and so I am glad for that. However, I also feel a little odd commenting on my progress as a developer mostly because "progress" to me denotes a process of growth and change that occurs over time. And I'm still just at the beginning--and I also haven't learned a lot of new material over these days. So honestly, I don't feel as though I've made huge progress as a developer yet, but at the same time, I'm not alarmed by that. I feel (hope?) I'm around where I'd expect or need to be. There's a long road ahead, still.
