# Functions Study

## Required Readings

These readings are to help familiarize you with the subject matter.

Please read the MDN Glossary entries for [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/array) and [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Object)

As well as the following articles:

-   MDN [function expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function) reference
// why would you ever want to use an anonymous function expression?
// short snippet that we won't reuse.  Common in jQuery.

-   JSIS [Callbacks](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-callback-functions-and-use-them/)
-   Quirksmode [Functions Basics](http://www.quirksmode.org/js/function.html)
-   JS Webblog [Function Declarations vs. Function Expressions](https://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/07/06/function-declarations-vs-function-expressions/)
-   MDN
 [Return](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/return)

Notes:
 // self invoking function expression
 // (function sayHello() {
      alert("hello!");
//  })();

Ben Cherry’s excellent article: “Function declarations and function variables are always moved (‘hoisted’) to the top of their JavaScript scope by the JavaScript interpreter”.

## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
Context (which ECMA 5 breaks into LexicalEnvironment, VariableEnvironment and ThisBinding) and Process.  Not so much confused as I just want to know more about these topics. [javascriptweblog]
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
The quirksmode article on funtions says that you can use Return to exit out of a function that might not execute correctly, but why wouldn't you use 'break' instead?
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I think it would be beneficial to focus on the creative aspect of problem-solving and be given problems which are more open-ended.  I also think we should work on problem-seeking more.  We should be learning how to find real world problems (that are either at our level or nearly within our grasp) and translate them into programming problems.  These are the types of skills I really want to be focusing on.  Besides this, I'm getting quite good at visualizing complex puzzles and finding interesting solutions to them.  I'm getting better at looking up new tools (such as underscore.js, math.js, and other libraries) to help solve issues with our homeworks.  I have already taken our practice problems and refactored some of them, renamed variables where approprate, shortened the code, and made some of the solutions more elegant (or made them more flexible by building in new features).  I'm getting into a good rhythm of workflow, and even if I write some messy, bad code, I can usually see where it can be improved and cleaned up once I get it functional.  I wish we focused more on TDD, but playing around with Grunt has been a good introduction, I just wish I knew more about what it was doing behind the scenes.  It seems like I'm on a good track though, and when things are slow during the review process, I have chosen to focus on helping my other squad members get up to speed and make sure they can clearly understand the weird code that I've written which is not always exactly what the instructors are writing on the board.
