## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

```md
I think the concepts make sense, but I have to really concentrate to follow the function logic for the more abstract concepts,like closures (including callbacks). I don't yet have the mind-muscle-memory for it to feel natural, so it takes me awhile to read through those types of higher-level functions. I think it will help when I start applying these new concepts to many different concrete examples.
```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
Not really. Just need a whole lot more practice to make it second nature.
```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md
I understand the concepts covered so far, but it's not yet second nature. So I feel slow, and I have to look back at examples constantly. But I do feel like I am to the point where I can start implementing my own functions, and that feels powerful. For most of the assignments and challenges, I know what I need to do to solve the problem, but it just takes me a long time. But I feel optimistic about my progress and confident that eventually the more difficult concepts will feel like second nature.
