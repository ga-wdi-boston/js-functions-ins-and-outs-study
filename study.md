## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

Woah, hoisting... I feel like this could be important but it lost me rather
quickly. I also don't fully have my head around callbacks, makes sense but I feel
like I need more examples/to do some practive with it.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
Still unsure about formatting, when should be use what formatting,
how do we make it so they can be used properly.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I'll make a water analogy. I had some comfort walking around in water but now
I'm getting in deeper so I'm getting a better idea of what I'm dealing with
but I don't know how to swim.
I can now form and test small chunks of code and change them to correct some
of the errors. I'm also getting better at seeing where my syntax problems
can be fixed. I still need to get more experience with working with objects,
functions, arrays etc so I can balance my time between figuring out what to
write and fuguring out how it should be written.
