## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
I'd like to practice common use cases of callback functions.
I had to do original study on function declarations vs expressions to follow.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
See comment above. Nothing additional.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I'm feeling good. I'm interested to understand more about how grunt tests
work and develop my own. In terms of already covered topics, I'd like more
review on accessing arrays (especially arrays within arrays).

```
