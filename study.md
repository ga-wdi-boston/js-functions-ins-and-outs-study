## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
<!-- confused about declarations and expressions.  Also feel like I am not on par with the course because I feel like I am not able to write code. -->
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
<!-- not so much that I have questions as that I need a TON more practice at actually writing code-->
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
<!-- I feel like I am behind in the course being that I am not able to write proper code yet.  Seems like some of the concepts I am starting to grasp but feel that I am way behind everybody now.  Basically I am at the bottom of the curve and hopefullt I can get to the upwards and onwards part.-->
