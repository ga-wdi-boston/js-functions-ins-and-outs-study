## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
I am confused about hoisting (or at least need clarification on why/when this is used - need better real world examples than foo and bar). I would also love clarification/real world example of when to use a named function vs not.




```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
I have noticed that there are quite a few built-in methods often used in functions - for example in one of the readings, one line read:
var numStr = num.toString() ...
is there a place that lists commonly (or not-so-commonly) used methods and their purposes?


```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

My biggest problems right now are execution. I feel as though I mostly understand the material during class, and when I am following along, I understand what it happening and why we are doing it. When I go to do it on my own, I tend to freeze up and don't know where to start. In the studies (particularly with MBTA) I felt as though I didn't know where to begin and didn't have enough knowledge of what was even available to me in JS to work on the problem (aside from a few basics). I had an idea of how I wanted to construct the program, but really struggled with the actual coding/execution (despite google, notes, etc.).

To that point, while I understand the materials on a conceptual level, my definitions are not quite there yet. I can point to code and tell you in layman's terms what it's doing, but I am struggling with putting the right term with the right piece of code (more studying to be done! :) )

Another issue I am facing is being able to check my code. In some cases my console.log works and in other cases it doesn't seem to. I am also confused about when its better to use console.log vs node (i know that node can only be used where we have done npm install, but I am unclear even in those cases when it's better to use one or the other). Basically, these two work during class, and then my own console.log and node checks often don't because I am putting in the wrong information somehow. Is there a general rule of thumb for this?

Overall, I feel pretty good and know that a lot of this comes with practice and time.
