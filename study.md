## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
Callback functions are definitely still confusing. The idea of a function within a function makes sense but the implementation is what is confusing. When do we use them?
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
I think I understand funcitons fairly well. I tried creating some of my own callback functions but struggled to get them to work so practicing this would be great
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I am feeling okay about my progress. What is happening in my brain is something that has never happened before.
I am fairly certain I understand all of the concepts of what we talk about in class but I struggle putting them into practice.

One example is the boggle challenge, I literally had no idea where to start and had to look at someone elses code after to see what might be happening.

I think this is partially my fault. Since class has started I have had very little time to sit down and zone out and learn some things and I think that will help.
```
