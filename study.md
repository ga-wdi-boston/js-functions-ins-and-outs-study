## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
One thing I'm confused about is 'context' vs. 'scope'. At first I thought they
were interchangeable terms, but it turns out they are not. It seems like context
applies only to objects and scope applies to functions, but I'm wondering if
'global scope' vs 'variable scope' muddles this explanation? Also, context always
refers to the value of t'his, correct?
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
None at the moment, but I'm sure I'll have some nagging questions when I return
for week 2 with a better grasp on functions as a whole. Sometimes it
takes a firm understanding to know what questions to identify and ask.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
So far I would say that at the moment I feel... scared? I knew going into the
course that it was going to be difficult and overwhelming, but so far it has
surpassed even my own lofty expectations. This is mostly do to the fact that
I have no prior experience in web development and very little established
knowledge of coding in general. I definitely feel like I've entered the course
knowing less than most of the other folks in the class (possibly all of them).
This has been compounded by the fact that I haven't used my atrophied brain in 3 years
because a well-trained monkey could have done my last job, which I just quit
1 week ago today. With that being said, fear is a great motivator; all this
means is that I'm going to have to put in more hours of study outside of class
so I can get to a point where I feel somewhat comfortable with the subject
material. I've made a commitment and would have massive regrets and embarrassment
if I went through the course without giving it my all. I knew that changing my
career - and in essence my life - was going to be incredibly hard.

So what's the plan of attack? First off, I'll be making flashcards and studying
10 to 15 hours this weekend so that I can at the very least establish a firm
grasp on coding jargon (which I severely underestimated the value of - Jeff pointed
this out in our 1-on-1) and deciphering functions, because at this point I can
barely read them. Thankfully, I have two close friends who are web developers
and I'll be leaning on them heavily for help this weekend and throughout the course
(I'm sure they're gonna love it).

Lastly, I just want to say that I've been more than satisfied with all three of
the instructors, and my lack of understanding is based entirely on my end. Only
I can make myself learn all of this stuff, and once I do I look forward
to utilizing all the instructor knowledge and goodness at my disposal to the fullest.
