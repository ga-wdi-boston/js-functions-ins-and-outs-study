## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
I didn't find anything confusing.  I'd like to practice callback functions, but I do understand why they're used (compartmentalizing code).
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
Not thus far.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I feel good about my progress as a developer.  I think I already had a good basic knowledge of JS, and I'm filling in gaps and getting further practice.  I didn't have experience working with classes, though, so I'm glad to have an understanding of those.
```
