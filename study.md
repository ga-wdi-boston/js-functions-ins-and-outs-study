## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
I think I can recognize the difference between a function expression and a
function declaration, but I am confused about how to decide which one is
appropriate to use in a given situation.

I also don't understand the relationship between 'function declaration' and
'function statement'.

The concept of hoisting doesn't make sense to me yet. The Angus Croll article
competely lost me there.

In the article on callback functions, I got the basic idea that functions can
be passed to other functions and executed inside them, but it looks awfully
easy to screw up and I'm not confident that I could do it correctly at this point.

I've noticed that a lot of the articles we've read this week have used code for
a JQuery button click as an example of something. These examples have been hard
to follow because I don't know the syntax yet.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
When a function is declared inside another function, and the outer function is
called, does the inner function run automatically? It was difficult to tell
from the examples given in the articles.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I feel like I'm where I should be right now. I have been able to follow all the
concepts covered in trainings so far and meet all the training objectives. I've
done well on the diagnostics. Parts of the study articles have confused me, but
I'm not really concerned by that, since most of these articles are written for
experienced developers, and we are still in our first week.

I'm kind of amazed at how quickly the basic git commands have sunk in. Using
them for every single training, diagnostic, study, etc. is great practice.
