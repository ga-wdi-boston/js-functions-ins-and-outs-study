## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
- when does .this refer to the window instead of my object in callback functions
- I didnt understand the example with jQuery’s AJAX function in the callbacks reading
- self invoking functions
- difference between function declaration and function expression
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
- nothing specific, I need more practice with specific examples, with a step by step approach
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I think I learned a lot in the last four days. I don’t know if I’m on the right track since it just started and I feel that I’m not comfortable with all the concepts yet.

Coming in with very little pre knowledge (some treehouse, code school etc.) I feel I learned a lot in very little time. Git/Github makes much more sense and I’m able to navigate via terminal- small victories!

I don’t have yet all the syntax in my head. I feel I need more time for each challenge and concept, but there are only 24h a day so I need to be clever about how I spend my time. The concepts will build on top of each other, which worries me.
