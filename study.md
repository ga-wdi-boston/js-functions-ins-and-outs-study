## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
All of the readings were quite straightforward, except maybe one on Callback functions for me. I understand that callsbacks are functions that are passed through other functions as parameters. However, I did not grasp everything that the article explained and don't necessarily see why there might be a difference set of rules for callbacks compared to regular functions.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
No, I don't have any specific questions so far. I just need some time to review and process the info.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I feel that I am slowly but steadily progressing as a developer. Although I know that I still have a LONG ways to go, I can definitely feel a difference compared to my first time looking at a piece of code or trying to read about it. It doesn't feel as foreign to me as it once did, and I can already start to recognize patterns. I like learning what the best practices are because even though I have learned many concepts there are a variety of subtle details that are not apparent right away and cause confusion down the road. So I know that I just have to keep on practicing and exposing myself to different types of problems then comparing my answers to correct solutions and finally learn from all my mistakes. It's only been a couple of days into the WDI program, and I can already see how intensive and exhausting it is. However, I am optomistic and very much looking forward to seeing where I will be 3 months from now.
