## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
I think confused might be the wrong word.  Maybe more practice is needed because I am unfamiliar with JS, but I'll get it soon.  
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
I'd like to read/learn more about these three topics from the articles.
callback functions
hoisting
and to a smaller extent, return.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

<!-- your answer here -->
I am thrilled to be a part of such a supportive company and community of people.  My co-developers are awesome and I love making small and consistent achievements with them.  On my own, I would never spend 60 hours a week coding and I love being pushed and to be held accountable.  About a third of my peers seem to be more experienced than me and it's wonderful that they're available to question.  Some of the people that seem to be less experienced have been great about asking me for advice and making me feel useful to them.  I am very confident that if I stick with the program I'll be employable.

The only thing I worry about is the projects that will be due soon.  Sometimes I feel like things that should take one week will take me two weeks because I spend way too much time googling a small problem for 3 hours when it should take 10 minutes or less.
