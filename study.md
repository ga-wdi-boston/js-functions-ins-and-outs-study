## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
I'm still not fully understanding callbacks or hoisting, but I'm not sure I
have specific questions yet. I plan to step away for a bit to try to reset and
read through the documentation one more time before bed tonight. Hopefully things
will start to sync in tomorrow.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
I don't think I have any at this point, aside from the ones mentioned above
related to our readings tonight.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I feel like I'm where I should be at this point. The new concepts we've learned
have been challenging and I certainly don't have an in-depth knowledge of anything
yet, but I also don't feel completely lost. I also feel like I've been conceptually
able to understand the solutions to problems within the labs, practices, etc., but
get slowed down a bit when it comes to translating my pseudo-code into actual
working JavaScript. Even when it's something I know we've covered in a code-along
or something, I sometimes have to go back to find that code to remember what
it looked like.
