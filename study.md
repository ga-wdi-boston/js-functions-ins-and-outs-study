## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

```md
I'm still shaky on the difference between a function declaration and a function
statement. If I am understanding the reading correctly, function statements/expressions
are not available in memory until run time. This could impact how code runs
depending how what is going on.

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
No
```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md
I feel ok. I think I got the fundamentals of what is being taught. I'll feel
even better after I've completed the challenges and some of the lab work that
I didn't get to complete in class. I wish we had more time to complete them, but
I get that not everyone works at the same pace and that we need to get through the
lesson. I think more of the workshop time to complete this will be very helpful.
```
