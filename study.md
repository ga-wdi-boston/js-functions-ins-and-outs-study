## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
Hoisted functions still confuse me, I'm very tired I will revisit the concept with a fresh mind tomorrow.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
To be honest, I don't think I know enough to know what I don't know yet - or even to know whether what I know is correct. However the reading seemed to make sense to me as I read it, but I am not confident I could reproduce the knowledge when asked.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
Obviously this is only 4 days in, but I am happy about my progress. I hardly understood anything about programming on Monday and here I am on Thursday trying to figure out concepts that may as well have been an alien language last Sunday. I am not happy with how the diagnostic went this morning, or my inability to even start the boggle challenge. However getting to that understanding does not feel impossible, and I am looking forward to the weekend to have time to go over what we have learned this week. 
```
