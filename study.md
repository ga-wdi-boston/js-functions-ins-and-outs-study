## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

Call back function seem a little confusing the way they are explained.  I think that walking through the labs in class helps clarify any of the vocabulary I read that may be confusing me.  I am gaining a better understanding of funtions and how to construct them for problem solving.  I have to continue to practice creating functions and implementing the new details we have learned during the week.

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

Not that I can think of at the moment.  I am sure I will have some specific questions after the week end reflection. I plan to drill down to the questions I have in into a list.

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

I feel that the process is going to be uphill.  I feel comfortable with the challege.  My only concern is my thought process is not as fast as others in the class.  I will undersand material in the code alongs and then go blank when the diagnostic or problem is put in front of me.  I think my bigest challege is getting started.  I might be overthinking things and second guessing.  I want to use the weekend to gather my questions that I might need further explaining or just hearing another point of view.
