# Functions Study

## Required Readings

These readings are to help familiarize you with the subject matter.

Please read the MDN Glossary entries for [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/array) and [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Object)

As well as the following articles:

-   MDN [function expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function) reference
-   JSIS [Callbacks](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-callback-functions-and-use-them/)
-   Quirksmode [Functions Basics](http://www.quirksmode.org/js/function.html)
-   JS Webblog [Function Declarations vs. Function Expressions](https://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/07/06/function-declarations-vs-function-expressions/)

## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
The different vocabulary to talk about a function. For example:
let x = function(y) {
   return y * y;
};

Is the parenthesis part called the parameter? Are the curly brackets part called input?

```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
If statements within functions and what's going on within them. Dictionaries, how can arrays work within a function.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I feel--to put the worst part first--that my progress has hit a stalling point with Javascript.
As far as with the command line, I feel comfortable using that, although not as comfortable as using the finder.
Using Git, I feel probably 4/5 as with what we have been using git so far in class for taking repositories from some other person's project. But as far as finding my older versions of projects and using it as a version control system to see older versions-- that is what I am uncomfortable with.
With JavaScript I am most uncomfortable with. Often times when instructors have sit down with me and tried to explain step by step what is going on in a loop, I do not understand the terms that instructors are saying, so basically cannot follow them very well. It would help to have an example code, then a diagram of the different parts of the vocabulary of the code for understanding the different parts of the JavaScript. I tried googling for something like this but have not found anything yet. Arrays I am somewhat familiar with in understanding. But for, if , if else loops I am starting to grasp hold of, but am no where close to being close to writing on my own with. As for the diagnostic today for writing functions (at least I think that's what is was about), I did not even begin to know how to write real code for it--I did not know how even begin. I did however, begin to write pseudo code, to help understand the foundation of what the questions were asking. I feel I am slowly catching up, but not as fast as the courses pace. It would be helpful if someone would go over javascript functions with me I think, although that has already happened for a brief period before.
