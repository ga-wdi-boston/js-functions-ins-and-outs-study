## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

```md
I'm still a little fuzzy on callbacks and declarations vs expressions but it's
mostly just that I need to use them more. ```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
I actually don't think so, but I suspect it's because I don't know what I don't know.
```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md
The first couple of days of class were easy and then wednesday afternoon got hard!
I've learned a ton but I can tell things aren't quite locked into place. I'm sure
that will come with doing it more. ```
