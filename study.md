## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
I found the JSIS reading a bit confusing. Maybe it has to do with the writing
style of the author. Some of the later code examples did help me understand
how the callback functions in JavaScript work, but I'm going to have to deal
with them in practice to have a better grasp.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
Is hoisting something we need to be particularly concerned about since we're
in the habit of always implementing 'use strict'? Is it mainly something we need
to learn about for when we're dealing with the code of other developers? I guess
that leads to the following question: should we ever not be using 'use strict'?
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I feel like there is so much more that I have to learn before I can be considered
qualified to work as a developer. I have been comfortable with the programming
assignments, diagnostics, challenges, etc. thus far, and I love hearing from
my other cohort-mates about how they tackled a particular problem. Our first Outcomes
session was encouraging, since the support from Julie seems like it will be helpful.

Should we already be feeling like we can use what we've learned to make things that
interact with a user? Because that's the kind of thing that I'm looking for direction
on.
