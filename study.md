## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
I found the 'Function Declarations vs. Function Expressions' article to be quite confusing.
I dont fully understand the consequences of the differences between statements and declarations.
I had previously assumed that declaration and expression were functionally the same,
except for the fact that I could write declarations anywhere.
This article suggested that function expressions should be preferred in nearly all cases,
so now I am rethinking my use of declarations.

```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
I do not fully understand the significance of closures.  I could probably
explain what a closure is and how its created, but I could provide an example
of a specific use case.  Almost everything I read about closures mentions the fact
that 'I am already creating and using closures without knowing it'.  I'd like to
get an idea of how closures can be used to solve specific problems.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I came into the course with a fairly strong self-taught background in HTML CSS and JavaScript,
so I haven't founnd any of the prework or coding material we have covered in class to this point that challenging.
I don't think I have struggled much with any of the challenges,diagnostics, or practices so far, with the exception of boggle challenge
(I failed to see that the coordinates were grid/column rather than x/y).
With that being said, I feel like I have learned a lot in the past week.
The git workflow, for example, is becoming second nature.
Also, I think I have benefitted from having to write code that someone else is
actually going to look at.  In my self-education, I have rarely had the opportunity
to be forced to submit my code to scrutiny.
Based on how quickly we are moving through the basic Javascript material, I am
fairly confident that it won't be long before we start covering material that is
brand new to me, which I'm looking forward to.
