## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

I was definitely confused about the hoisting concept. It seems like there are many ways to declare variables including functions in js but I guess one of the points of the article was that function expressions are a more versitile and safer (in terms of not leading to unexpected consequences) way of declaring functions.
I understood the callback function articles and appreciate their utility and functionality but my experience with recursion in Python leads me to believe that these are similar concepts. I was very confused about recursion in Python and while I undeestand the concept in js practice will be required in order to fully understand the concept to the point where I am able to practically use it.

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

I understood everything the articles presented but I know I will need a bunch of practice in order to be able to practially apply in in my own code. At that point I am sure that I will have new questions once I start running into problems. At this point, however, I understand the articles on a conceptual level.

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

So far, I definitely feel just OK about my progress as a developer. I have some programming experience with Python and while I am finding some concepts easy to understand others are more difficult. I'm the type of person who feels the need to understand everything about something before I am able to apply it. The first two days of WDI were great because it seemed to start off a little slower but when the collections.js lab came around I found myself in an uncomfortable place. While that is normally a good thing during learning I think the collections lab required too much of a leap of knowledge. I didn't really understand what each piece of code was doing so to combine them into a working function was very difficult for me. I definitely feel like I am learning a lot about JavaScript though and while its only the first week I am excited to be challenged further and to create more complex and interesting programs. I've heard from individials who completed the course that things start to click around week 6 or 7 so I am excited to get to that point and to further increase my understanding of JavaScript and other languages used in web devlopment.
The challenges I had in yesterdays's (12Jan17) lab made me realize that I should probably be practicing writing more JavaScript while at home so I will try to find a website where I can answer questions and write code in order to solve small problems. That should hopefully make me feel better than I do now (fist of five: 3) about my progress thus far in the course.
