## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
I thought I understood the basics of most of the keywords before and theoretically
followed the examples, but I still am not good at actually using them.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
I don't know that I have any specific remaining questions, but I feel like I still
often don't know what parts to place inside a function, that I'm building, to make
it do what I need it to do. I am also still confused about what the different parts of most
prebuilt functions actually say. If someone asks me to go line by line through a
function and explain what it says, I'm lost. In addition, looking at a prompt and understanding
what kind of function I need to create to fufill the prompt requirements, is
completely beyond me right now.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
Bahhh! I feel like I don't know anything that we've learned comprehensively, I may
understand, or think that I understand something, but have no idea how to transfer
that knowledge into actual, working code. I know that I am learning and there are
probably small packets of knowledge that I have that I don't even realize I have.
I feel like I'm being asked to write an essay, but I'm still learning the
individual letter of the alphabet. Or like I'm learning to read French, but I
still have to go through each word, translate it into English and then put all the
words in the order that they should be in English so that I can to understand
the sentence.
