## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

```md
I get the concept, but my understanding is superficial at this point.
```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
I correlate a function / method as an action that an entity can take. Thinking about it as a VERB is what gets me to understand function.
```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md
I am learning lots of concept, but understanding them is one thing. I feel I lack the ability to be able to apply it efficiently. When given precise instructions, I do fine. But I am extremely slow to get started in the challenges.

However, compared to day one: I know enough to write code! ```
