## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

```md
I'm feeling pretty good on all of this.
I feel like I would really benefit from studying the standard built-in objects in JavaScript, so I'm going to do that.
```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
Not at this time.
```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md
I'm feeling pretty solid. I came into this having worked in technology for several years, and even with a couple years
being very hands-on, so a lot of this is a refresh, not having to learn it for the first time. The more I learn the more
I realize I don't know and need to learn, but I know that is normal and part of software development. Things are always
changing so being worried about having to know every detail is nearly impossible.
```
