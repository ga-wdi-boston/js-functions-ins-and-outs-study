## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

```md
I'm not sure that I fully understood Callback functions. The basic concepts are fine, about objects, arrays, return and functions. From what I get, Callback functions are functions inside functions and they are not executed when called inside another function. I feel like I need to put it into practice to really learn the concept.
```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
I still don't get how I could use a constructor function to create an object with an array of other objects inside.
```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md
I'm comfortable with being uncomfortable. I like the challenges and I feel like I'm progressing. Although I still have a long way to go, I'm definitely learning a lot.
I get most of the concepts and I'm still learning how to think logically.
```
