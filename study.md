were confused about.

```md
<!-- Overall, I understand what everything is, but not necessarily how they are
used or excecuted. I don't expect to understand everything right away. I think that
with more practice, JavaScript will start to click. Until then, I am taking
notes on everything that doesn't make sense to me and studying. -->
```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
<!-- Not that I can think of at the moment. -->
```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md
<!-- As of right now, I am not afraid to admit that I have a lot to learn.
I am confident that with keeping focus, studying, and asking questions that
I will be able to pass this course and make a career out of web development.
Right now, I don't believe that I am anywhere close to that but I am learning
and growing each day in class.  -->
