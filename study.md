## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

I think I get this set of readings.  I just realized, having done the readings,
that I can run the code snippets of them in node, and I've found that showing
the results in the console is more... satisfying and helps things stick in my
memory than simply reading what the website thinks they ought to do.
```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
While I was doing my precourse work I really struggled with trying to figure out
when to call an argument in a function and when not to.  I'm pleased to say
that I understand it much better now!  I feel like I have functions pretty well
understood at this point.
```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

Honestly, today was a little rough.  I had to miss class on Wednesday to go to
court for my divorce.  While emotionally I'm doing pretty well with that, I
didn't figure out that I could check out and read the solutions branch of the
lesson to reconstruct the code-along until today in class, so I was completely
unprepared/unable to handle the diagnostic.  On the other hand, I have some hope
 - I was able to start breaking down the challenge into solvable chunks.
Starting code from scratch is still very intimidating, but I'm starting to find
that messing around on paper helps me organize my thoughts and start working.
I'm a little overwhelmed by the process of putting all the pieces together to
make things into a website, but I feel like I'm learning well and keeping up
(dare I even say enjoying?) the pace of the course.
