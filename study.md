## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
I'm still a little unclear on Callback Functions, since some of the examples
were from jQuery, and I am unfamiliar with the situations presented in most of
the JS examples.  Undeclared functions also seem to act in a way that I am
fuzzy on.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
Mostly just the above.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
Overall, feeling pretty good!  I feel solid on most everything we have gone over
this week, and can sense myself iproving as I work on more and more examples/
practice.  I think I would benefit from a review of callback functions and going
over when it is advantageous to use undeclared functions and how exactly they operate.
