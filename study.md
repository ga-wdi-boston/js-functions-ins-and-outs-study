## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

```md
I don't undertand template literals.
I don't understand functional expression & hoisting.
I need more training on callback functions.  There' a lot to absorb and it's not making sense to me.
```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
I understand the difference between function declaration and function expression, but donâ€™t know which one I should use & when & why.
```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md
I knew I would be a slower learner than most - that's just how it always is for me.  But once I get it (things click), I'll crush it.  I'm not close to being there yet.  Practice, practice, practice.
```
