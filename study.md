# Functions Study

## Required Readings

## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
I'd like to have a better understanding of closures (which are mentioned briefly in the MDN Return and JSIS Callbacks articles). At this point, I can parrot definitions I've read, but I don't yet feel 100% comfortable explaining them. Hoping/guessing we cover this later in the course.

Also a bit unclear on call vs. apply and the situations in which you'd choose one over the other. Based on the readings, they seem fairly interchangeable. 
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
Not right now.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give an extensive answer?

```md
I'm feeling great. I had my one-on-one with Jeff today and mentioned that I'm pretty comfortable getting basic things done in JavaScript (I took a semester-long intro to programming in JS class last spring), but I feel like most of my code right now is dirty, or at least not as smooth as it could be. I'm looking forward to continuing to deepen my knowledge of JavaScript as a language and to refining my understanding of convention and theory going forward so that I can write better, cleaner, more elegant code, and do it all more fluently and efficiently.

I'm excited to have these twelve weeks to focus intensely on coding (as opposed to doing it on the side) and to revisit some of the concepts I've learned elsewhere, learn more of the nuances, and practice, practice, practice. So far, I'm enjoying the program and feeling like it's helping me gain a much more stable footing. I'm *really* looking forward to projectsâ€”I can't wait to put what we're learning right now together into a larger piece of work. 

All that to say: so far, so good!
