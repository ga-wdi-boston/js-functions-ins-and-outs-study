## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
from inside a call back function, how can I assign a value to a variable outside the call back function?
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
how does it work / what happens when a function is written but not assigned.

like
function (){} or function functionName(){}

VS
let x = function ()


```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
Pretty good, I feel like I'm at a level around 25% in the class, so could be worse. I hope to catch up this weekend.
I like that all the skills and the format im learning in is all focused

```
