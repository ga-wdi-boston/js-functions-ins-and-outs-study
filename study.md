## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
The Function Declarations vs. Function Expressions article was a little
confusing regarding hoisting, but I think I understand it (and if I understand
it correctly, we shouldn't have to deal with it much, as we use function
expressions almost exclusively). Apply and call were also a bit confusing, but
that feels like something that I'd just need to practice a few times and it won't
be too difficult. Otherwise, I'm not that confused about functions. The
callbacks article was quite good.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
Not really? I found through some research that overloading constructors isn't
really a thing in Javascript, but I was curious about that earlier today.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I'm feeling pretty good, but I've had a bit of a headstart, and I know that's
about to run out, so we'll see how it goes when everything is completely new
again. I feel quite comfortable with algorithms, flow control, and objects, but
I could use some more practice with inheritance. I feel weaker on design and
aesthetics with HTML and CSS. I'm definitely looking forward to being
reintroduced to jQuery and other frameworks to help manipulate the DOM as well.
I have been learning plenty these past few days though, even though I've
already seen a lot of the material before. If we've already covered this much
by Day 4, I'm very excited to see where we are on Day 60.
