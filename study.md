```md
I think I probably could have a better grasp on the variable scope of callback
functions but feel pretty decent about it.
```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
I dont think so.
```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md
I feel really good. What i knew at the start of the week vs what i know now is
amazing. I have learned that i need to dive deeper into concepts. Once i
think i know something I need to not trust myself and dive deeper into anyways.
Overall though i feel really good about the progress im really excited to keep
going and learn more and more
