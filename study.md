## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
At first, after reading https://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/07/06/function-declarations-vs-function-expressions/, I was confused about "hoisting." However, I re-read it, I was able to follow it. This also cleared up the pros and cons of declarations and expressions. I now feel more confident about that.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
No, I am excited to apply what I learned in these readings. I'm curious to try implementing callback functions.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I feel great about the rapid progression so far. Things I have seen before have become much clearer as well as learning new things. It's great being able to learn the newest aspects of Javascript.  
```
