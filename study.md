## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

'This' still confuses me. I understand how we've used it so far, which I think have been the more straightforward cases, but the readings described a lot of other use cases that I didn't quite understand. The examples used in the articles to descibe it used code we haven't learned yet to explain it, which may be why, but it made it even more difficult to follow.

Also struggling on nailing the correct terminology for properties/attributes/etc.

```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
So far, I feel like I have a decent grasp on most of the concepts we've learned, but I'm having the most difficulty in executing them. Meaning, I think I 'understand' functions or think I know how I could solve a particular problem, but then I can't quite the narrow down code I'm looking for. Does that make sense? I think it will come with time but that is my biggest struggle.

I also incorrectly structured my functions in my last diagnostic, so I think I need more practice and exposure in writing them. And stuggling using the shorthand syntax for if else statements.
