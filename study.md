# Functions Study

## Required Readings

These readings are to help familiarize you with the subject matter.

Please read the MDN Glossary entries for [Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/array) and [Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Object)

As well as the following articles:

-   MDN [function expression](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function) reference
-   JSIS [Callbacks](http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascript-callback-functions-and-use-them/)
-   Quirksmode [Functions Basics](http://www.quirksmode.org/js/function.html)
-   JS Webblog [Function Declarations vs. Function Expressions](https://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/07/06/function-declarations-vs-function-expressions/)
-   MDN [Return](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/return)

There is no requirement to follow any links from these pages.

## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.
```md

I'm confused on the "interrupt a function" part of "return". I'm also confused by the function used in that example within that MDN article. I don't understand why there are semicolons after the "1" and before the "count++". I also don't understand where the code accounts for the "until 5" which is commented out. I know the example is supposed to be showing how "return" is used as an interruption, but I should be able to understand the function as well...
    for (var count = 1; ; count++) {
    console.log(count + "A"); // until 5

Generally, I'm confused when I have to solve a problem (be it a diagnostic, a lab, homework) using functions. I can basically understand what they're doing when I'm provided a function, but assigning variables is confusing to me.

Function expression vs function declaration (also confused on the differences). I'm confused about a lot outside of what's covered in just these articles too (i.e. object conductors, "this", etc.).
Also, I need to practice more so I'm comfortable with the syntax of using "{}" "[]" "," ";" correctly.



```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
 Yes, there are many. My answer to the first question addresses a couple.
 My challenge is knowing how to approach a problem and begin using a function to solve that problem at hand. I think that's less about functions specifically and more about thinking like a computer or developer so I can even begin to break down a problem presented in a lab / challenege etc.
When I'm provided a function, I basically can understand what's happening (most of the time). 



Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I am feeling insecure/worried about my ability to become a developer. Thinking programatically is one of the big barriers right now, and also understanding the various definitions and how to use / not use them appropriately is challenging. I have learned a ton already, which is an indication that I CAN do this, but feel I am learning a bit slower than I expected coming into the course. I'm also struggling with simply not being good at something and not letting that itself get in the way of progress. I do think I need to do a ton of practice on JS basics outside of the course material to feel more at ease. Once things are explained to me, I do understand what's happening within functions (though the material on "this" / object constructors / prototypes has me SUPER lost, and I think I need to understand more first before I'll be able to grasp those concepts.)
