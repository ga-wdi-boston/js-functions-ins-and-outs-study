## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
Still a little confused about how to attach methods but I'm pretty confident
it will become evident with practice.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
I had a question about callbacks within callbacks within callbacks, but Jeff
answered that in class the other day.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I knew I was going to approach the immersive with a serious attitude, but I'm
surprised at how much pleasure I can get out of solving coding challenges,
particularly issues that can be thought about visually. I feel I need more
practice outside of class writing JavaScript just to get more comfortable with
it, but I'm already starting to see the interesting possibilities of how JS and
JQuery can interact with the static elements in a web project. Can't wait to get
started on TicTacToe.
