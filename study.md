## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

```md
Not confused, just consiously trying to use th right terminology. This is a new language to me, after all. :)
```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
what are functions within objects called..methods?
```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md
I'm pleased with the progress I have made, but I wish I were making it quicker. For example over the weekend I was able to seamlessly work through the MBTA.js practice and refactoring the meal.js practice and I felt really pleased with that. However, the prototyping from Friday is 2/5 at best. So I'm always about a day behind it seems.
