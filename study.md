## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
for instance,
function x(a,b,callback){
var c=5;
var d=a+b;
}
so, callback can pass a, b and d, can it pass c, which is 5?
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
when to use function declaration or function expression?
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
The most important thing I learned so far is how to learn. I feel more comfortable when I face something totally strange. Although I still have confusion on some concepts we learned in class, I believe I'll get better understandings when I enter a higher level. 
```
