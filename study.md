## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md

I think I basically understand most of it in prinnciple, although actually
applying it is another story. I would like to maybe see more explaination of
the callback functions and how the hoisting works.

```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md

Again in principle it makes sense, although applying it without the examples in
front of me might not be easy.

```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md

I do feel that I've made progress having come in with no real html, css or js
experience, although I don't have much confidence yet in doing anyhting 
substantive.

```
