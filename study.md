## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

```md
I am stil confused about the callback function. It seems like it is a "function within a function", but I know that is likely me oversimplyfing it. I have found that some of the readings end up confusing me more than they provide clarity.


Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md

```
I think (hope) that I will understand the usage better the more I practice actually writing code and follow along with in-class lessons. Like I mentioned before, the information doesn't always translate strictly from the readings.

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```It's hard to say. At this point, I feel like I don't know enough to even assess my progress. I am now comfortable using the Terminal and GitHub. Prior to WDI I had some experience with html and css, so I am not too nervous about moving forward with those topics. Javascript is definitely a work in progress. I understande the components (ojbect, arrays, functions), but I do not believe my execution (i.e. when to use what, how to write it out/syntax, etc.) has improved yet. If I'm being completely honest, I am extremely apprehensive about the upcoming project. I think my "saving grace" thus far has been knowing where to find the answers to my questions in Git Hub, and a fair amount of literal copying and pasting...
