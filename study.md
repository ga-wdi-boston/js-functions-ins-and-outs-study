## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
I'm still a little confused about when to use prototypes and "this" but feel this concept will make more sense as we continue pushing forward. I do think it would've been immensely helpful to have these articles sooner, maybe around day 2, as I more or less learned how to use objects, arrays, functions, and the return statement, but never knew the exact definitions/instances of invocation for each.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
No nagging questions; I do need more practice to feel more confident when approaching novel problems and crafting increasingly elaborate functions but I think that will come in time.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I'm a little unsettled by how much I overthink problems and by how inept I am at finding solutions. I don't feel confident crafting any functions from scratch but instead rely on a combination of memorization, pattern recognition, and copied code from previous exercises/Google/etc.

While I do feel better after today in terms of recognizing patterns for writing functions, I am often tripped up when I begin tackling an exercise and still need help getting oriented in the right direction. I am generally able to follow the lectures, but am frustrated that I still have trouble articulating what I want to do in plain language and then later struggling to translate what language I do have into usable code.

On the upside, I do feel like I have good control of the command line functions in the terminal, which is somewhat validating. And I do understand, to varying degrees, what is happening in the code/solutions after I see it, but have trouble creating it from the outset. I hope it's alright to feel this way as I don't want to fail down the line if I should at a more advanced level by now.
