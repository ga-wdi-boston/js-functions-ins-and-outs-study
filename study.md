## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

```md
With call back functions, I read a common theme on various sites and youTube videos about functional programming
and Composition. I'm confused on what is composition. I get that you are breaking down bigger problemsi into
smaller functions that can be reused by other functions. But isin't that what all functions do? Why are These callback functions any different from a composition standpoint.

Didn't really follow the section below on my first read:
Problem When Using Methods With The this Object as Callbacks

```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
What are Arrow Functions? I've even seen it in the MBTA solution but we haven't yet covered in class and
makes that solution hard to follow.
Also I'm still not clear on how use loop through an object. I understand the for loop but not the for each loop that I've seen on some solutions.

When we use these call back functions are we passing a reference variable to the function or is it an entire copy of the function that is been passed around.
```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md
1) I have had no success yet on how to run any test in grunt. What I do is run in JSBIN.com or in Chrome Console and do a bunch of console.log commands to test the output (like in MBTA). But I have zero knowledge on how to use grunt and have spent too much time on it myself. Its on my first 1-1 meeting with consultant when they are set up.

2) I think it is VERY important to try to build in some catch up time on Wed and on Fridays. I really need a few hours in afternoon to digest and finish assignments or labs by myself. Without that baked in, I'll just fall behind on new material coming at me every day.

3)I do not understand avgDailyCalories method in this solution especially the days Count.
~/wdi/trainings/js-objects-this/lib (training)/mealsSoln.js

4) I fall behind at time on the Code along exercise during class as I find the pace of the instructor too fast to keep up and spend more time typing than listening and so miss key concepts.

5) I do not enjoy the squad based sessions each day as I know I am behind the others on the team and it doesn't help my stress level. I much prefer working by myself in the early stages and/or work with consultant on 1-1 time.

6) I find the class lecture and immediately followed by a lab as too challenging. I barely have time to take in the class lecture and then have to do a lab. I really don't understand material until I get to read online on Google (similiar to this weekend homework). I wish we had a lecture, followed by an hour of reading on that lecture to let it sink in more, followed by a self study lab (and then reinforced bt a homework). Some labs have been a waste of time because I didn't follow the lecture.
7)
7) Sorry to add more....and has nothing to do with functions ...but I cannot remember much from Mike's Git Hub and branching lecture. I'm fine with the rest of Git hub commands ....but not branching. Just need to 'use' it i Guess.

Thank you!
