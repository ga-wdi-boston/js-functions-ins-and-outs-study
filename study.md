## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
I don't understand this example here:

var a = function bar() {
    return 3;
}

```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
Aside from "it's tighter", I'm curious as to why it's recommended to do function expressions instead of
function declarations, since the latter can be hoisted.

Also, why do you need a function expression to assign a function to a prototype?
Why doesn't a function declaration work?
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
Since I've had the FEWD and JavaScript classes, I'm feeling much better than
I was the last time I attempted WDI. I am a bit worried about the backend stuff,
but in terms of what we've had this week, so far so good.
