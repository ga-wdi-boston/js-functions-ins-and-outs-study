## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

```md
The readings are pretty straight forward.  I think I need to work through examples with callback functions to fully understand it.
```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
I don't have any nagging questions related to functions, I think I just need more
practice and examples.  
```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md
Overall I think I'm progressing slowly but surely as a developer.  I think I just need more practice with functions and modeling.  It makes sense when we go through modeling
examples but I have a hard time constructing the model myself.
```
