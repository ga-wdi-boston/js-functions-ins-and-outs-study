## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

```md
Callback functions and issues with "this". The reading didn't provide a lot of examples for this topic, but I suspect this will be clearer as we are exposed to more code and encounter the
issues ourselves.

```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
No.

```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md
So far, so good! In a week's time I have learned a ton. I feel as though I can work through
the provided problems, given enough time, and produce working code. That said, I think there
is a lot of room for improvement in terms of simplifying my code and recognizing where
I could use one line of code instead of 5 to achieve the same result.

I have found my rhythm working with js code and leveraging the tools I like
most to run lines in parallel. In the beginning, it was a struggle to efficiently
tinker with code and run it as I went to debug (using node in terminal or JS Bin).
I now have atom set up to function as an IDE using Hydrogen, which is backed by Jupyter project kernels, and that has made a huge difference (my husband helped me get this set up - https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen).

I'm looking forward to learning more about how to effectivley use git for real world
projects. I'm also excited to further explore js and tie it in with HTML/CSS.
