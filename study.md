## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

```md
<!-- Why would you need to name a function inside of itself
in the named functions example on MDN they show:
var math = {
  'factorial': function factorial(n) {
    if (n <= 1)
      return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
  }
};
Maybe I'm just confused by line 33 b/c that
references a math function Factorial? But I thought it
was supposed to reference itesl
-->
```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
Whats the run-time order fo callback functions, with THIS?  One of the articles talked about it, but I'm gonna need to work through examples to really get it.
```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md
<!-- Overall I feel preety good.  I think I'm getting the
approach of solving the problem in front of you and breaking
it down to managable peices.

Looking forward to learning more tools/approachs as we dig
deeper into JS. -->
```
