## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
I'm still a little bit confused about callback functions, and the nested functions in the javascriptweblog link are kind of daunting.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
I can't think of any specific questions, but I'm sure I'll have some during class tomorrow.
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
Although I've spent the past year or so learning JavaScript (in a random, hodge-podge sort of way) the way the classes have been structed so far has helped to clarify and strengthen some of the concepts that I had passing familiarity with. I feel my progress has gone well during this first week.
