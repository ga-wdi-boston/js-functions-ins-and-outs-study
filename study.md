## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

```md
One thing I am confused about is exactly what happens in the application flow when a callback function is used. I think the application goes into a loop, just listening for events, after the original function sends the callback function and finishes executing. Then, some time in the future, when the apporpriate conditions have been met, the callback function is executed. I think this frees up the CPU in between assinging and executing the callback.

After writing out the explaination, it sounds close to making sense.
```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
I'm still not entirely sure where to put functions that need to run when an object is created (i.e., an init() function that requires using another function that would be added thorugh a prototype declaration). Should these always be part of the constructor or added on as prototype functions? Other than that, I'm in pretty good shape.
```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md
I'm feeling pretty good. A lot of what we covered in the first week was in the prep work for WDI or was a concept I was familiar with prior to the course. There was enough new material (callback functions, ECMA 2015 additions to JS, prototypes), to feel like my knowledge and skills increased in a significant way.

One of the things that really helped me this past weekend was reviewing the spec for the tic-tac-toe project that's coming up before I began the reading. I found it very helpful to use that project as a context when I was going through the study readings and doing some code sketches with a real world example to think about with regard to object properties, functions, prototyping, context for this, iteration techniques, etc.

All in all, having fun, looking forward to pushing the envelope.
