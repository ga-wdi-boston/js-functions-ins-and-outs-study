## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
<!-- I'm still havinga really hard time with functions and everything built up from, but I think its really silly
confusions; like understanding the syntax in one example but having a such a vague
grasp on it that in a new contaxt I'm boggled by a similar expression. I know just
 need a lot more practice with them and I feel like i had an easier time understanding their basics
 in fundamentals and my own studying in the context how js was used on a web page to structure interactions with
 forms and buttons than i am with the more abstract examples. Like the superhero examples with constructors yesterday made a a lot of sense and i can see why that example should seem more accessible, but halfway through kind of getting it i just hit a mental block on them. -->
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
<!--So many. I think I understand the most basic javascript functions, at least a vague
undertstanding of "this" and why we use it but everything beyond that is sketchy at best. I feel
like I understand and following along during the lectures and then when it comes time to implment them
into code I draw a blank--an obvious signal I don't understand them very well. -->
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
<!-- Honestly I'm feeling way worse than I was Monday and Tuesday, but trying to maintain
the same attitude I went in with and hoping that persistence+time+exposure+repetition =>
understanding eventually. I think the lack of sleep is what's holding me back the most
I'll be remedying that this weekend and next week.

I feel like I'm gaining invauable tools for shifting my paradigm in how i think
about problems, learning and what the gestalt of a devleloper mindset is--but that
most of the information i process is a little too scattered to connect all the pieces into a fluid understanding.
I think i screwed myself over by shutting down and not reaching out for help enough somewhere between tuesday afternoon up until our current progress and that small dip in comprehension in such a breakneck pace has resulted me falling behind exponentially. I'm freaking out a little--but confident
in choosing WDI and GA, just struggling with having a such a vague understanding of so many
important syntaxes and fundamental mechancics. I'm worried about getting caught back up, but determined
to make damn sure I do I'm hoping that between now and our first project that I start to tie my understanding of the js concepts I struggle the most with into the context of html and css facets I'm more comfortable with--I mean that I hope in the process of integrating all of those pieces together I start to have a lot more aha moments about js and OOP concepts that are eluding me. -->
