## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

```md
I'm still confused on how to write a function with a loop to get multiple answers back. Also writing functions in general although I understand how they work, I'm still unsure on how to use the criteria to create the outcome I'm looking for.
```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
I really would like to know more about the process of understanding a set of criteria and implementing them into a function that can give me the result I'm looking for. Looping in its definition is a somewhat easy concept to grasp but using them in functions to get multiple result still confuses me.
```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md
Trufully I had a very good feeling about my progress up until yesterday. I came to a wall and nothing from then until now has made much sense. There are times in class that I start to understand a topic and before the full definition is given someone in the class will interupt and we will end up going off course, from what should have been a decent definition, to a 10 minute talk about all the other things the topic shouldn't do. Which in my opinion can get a little hard to follow. All that being said, I feel like my knowledge coming into this course (0 with no past formal education) has definetly been expanded and I feel as tho even though I am stuggling right now I feel like I can make it thru this course.
