## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
from the reading, I'm not fulling understanding what the difference between a regular function and a callback function is. ```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
There's a bunch. Ill ask you guys using specific examples during the workshop block. ```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I feel that I understand the concepts and how things work when I am reading the material and following along in the lessons. But my mind completely goes blank and I get lost when trying to replicate the same programs from scratch. ```
