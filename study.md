## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

It seems that with most of these concepts I am fine with the conceptual uses of them, but when it comes time to putting anything together on my own I have blank screen panic.

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

I feel different about it about 200 times a day. Yesterday I felt especially crappy and tried to figure out why. I realized that I am getting very frustrated at my uneven progress. I'm grasping the conceptual basis for most of what we're learning about but when it comes time to put together any meaningful code I don't even know where to start. I think I learn better with lots of examples so that I can start picking up patterns and connecting the conceptual with the practical.

I'm looking forward to having some time this weekend to go over these concepts again and seek out more examples and some more ways to practice them on my own.

I'm actually looking forward to having time to give myself new homework so that's a weird feeling..
