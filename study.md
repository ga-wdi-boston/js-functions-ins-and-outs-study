## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

```md
<!-- I am working on absorbing the concept of prototype more.  I have been
'Googling' and re-reading everything to catch any that I did not comprehend
first, second, third,... times around.

The Getter() stuff is a bit vague and I'll be spending additional time this
evening to explore it more.

The concept of hoisting is a bit abstract but I'm working on it.  Can you
please go over this concept?  I did some additional 'Googling' of the term in
our context but any tips to visualize this would be beneficial.   I liked
this site: http://adripofjavascript.com/blog/drips/variable-and-function-hoisting

One other idea that I think I understand is that if we are writing the
function expression, we have to define it before we write the expression.

Am I looking at this the correct way?

I take the calling of functions before their definition at face-value.  I am
understanding that we can call a function and then define it farther down in
the code.   -->
```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
<!-- Yes, see above.  Also I'm still trying to sharpen my vision of what
the module export is.

Am I understanding this correctly:

in the javascriptFile.js, I need to add at the end

  module.export = {Object1, Object2,}

that I will be using in node.  So then in Node, I write

>let objectVariable = require('relativepathname/javascriptFile.js')

and then I'm able to use those objects?  Is that correct?  so then I can write

let brandNewObject = Object()1

?? Am I understanding that correctly?

-->
```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md
<!-- I feel hopeful that I will master this but need to re-read things
repeatedly.  My preconceptions from using C back in the day I think may
be hindering my vision of Javascript but I'm pushing back my own self to
ignore them.  I have hope!  I enjoy doing this but feel like at like  65% level
and will be putting in additional time to make sure I go over and over what
we did in class and follow all links.  I am also readjusting how I will be
tracking what we cover in class -->
