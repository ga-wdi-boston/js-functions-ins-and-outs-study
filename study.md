## Share Your Understanding

After reading all of the required readings, please tell us anything that you
were confused about.

```md
I did want to learn a little bit more about use case for function declarations.  Additionally, some added detailed about a "named" function expression would be helpful.  Callback functions seem like they would be be helpful to learn through a codealong.

```

Are there any nagging questions related to functions that you have?

```md
For CallBack function, what are the best practices on how to implement or structure them?
Could you provide more detail about the Apply function and it's use.
```

Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md
I am feeling pretty good about my progress.  I feel like the
consultants are doing a great job of explaining the material.  The code alongs
, labs, and challenges are extremely helpful.  I also find a lot of value in the group coding projects as I get to learn from my peers.
