## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
Callback functions have me pretty thoroughly confused. I can sort of understand
the basic concept behind them but am unsure about how to manipulate them and
when it would be good to use them.
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
Aside from the aforementioned Callback functions I am having a little trouble
keeping all the type of function declarations straight in my head. There seems
to be many ways to create a function and depending on how you create them they
seem to behave a little differently. I am hoping that with more review and
implementation these ideas will crystallize for me eventually.

Fat arrow functions in particular seem tricky and how they relate to 'this'
when used in the body of the function
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
I feel like I have come a long way in the short time we have been learning. I
have never excelled at Math so I am hoping that won't hold me back with
JavaSript. When we are going over concepts together as a class I seem to be able
to follow along and grasp the ideas that are being explained, but when it comes
time to begin coding I have trouble figuring out where to start. I know it is
early in my programming journey so I am trying to not be hard on myself but it
can be disheartening to stare at the screen without knowing where to begin
especially when David, my squad member, is sitting next to me and seems to be
firing on all cylinders as soon as we start working individually on a problem.

David and Ying have been very helpful with sharing ideas and pointing me in the
right direction, so I am hoping that as I watch them attack a problem I can
start to implement their techniques and their approach to dissecting the issue
as well as the debugging and grunt test processes. I think one major issue is
I have trouble breaking down a large problem into smaller problems so I try to
bite off more than I can chew right from the start. I am hoping to do a little
research on how developers succeed at this when I have some free time but so far
this week that hasn't really existed. If there is something in particular that
you have noticed me struggling with (other than not sleeping enough) definitely
let me know as I am pretty much betting the farm on the WDI program and I am
putting as much effort as I can muster into making it work but I'm sure at some
point I will lose sight of the forest for the trees.

Lastly for some reason I have been hesitant to schedule 1 on 1 times or come to
the instructors with an issue so I think I will have to deal with whatever is
making me feel that way because I'm sure as soon as I don't have you guys to
help me I will wish that you were there.
