## Share Your Understanding

After doing all the required readings please tell us anything you were confused about.

```md
<!-- I am a bit confused about how to impliment call back functions. I understand the definition based from the readings and information i've found on google however i would need to apply it myself to fully understand what a callback function can do for me. -->
```

Are there any nagging questions relating to functions that you have?

```md
<!--  No  -->
```

Thus far how are you feeling about your progress as a developer, please give
an extensive answer?

```md
<!-- I am more advanced now than when I started GA however I feel there is a ton of information that I still need to gather and practice. I am not as confident as I would like to be with my skills but I am determined and with time I will be able to utilize the information that has been given by the instructors.

I know how to research and ask questions better and use the resourse available to me which makes me feel good.  -->
