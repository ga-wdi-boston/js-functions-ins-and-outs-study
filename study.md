```md
First of all, I feel really happy to understand the basics of Git. Before starting this course, I was playing with it but it was always creating problems form me. Now I feel relieved.
One of the other changes that I am constantly passing through is learning jargon of web development and start using these words in our conversations.
I donâ€™t feel overwhelmed by the information that has been transmitted by the course but I feel absence of practice for creating the skills. On the other hand, this was the forth day of the course and I am sure we will be having lots of opportunities.
