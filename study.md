Thus far, how are you feeling about your progress as a developer? Please give an
extensive answer.

```md
After the first week of WDI the pace is certainly what I expected - fast and a
bit overwhelming at times. What concerns me is many of the topics we've covered
were introduced in the Fundamentals pre-work and I worry as we are exposed to
completely new topics the learning curve will be even greater. I feel confident
in grasping topics now but it's primarily because I have a little familiarity with
what has been covered so far. I struggled with Friday's diagnostic and it
worries me that I will begin to fall behind as new concepts are introduced.
I've been working on labs and re-reading material outside of class and hope
continuing to expose myself to code will make me more comfortable.
